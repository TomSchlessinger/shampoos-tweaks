# SHAMPOO'S TWEAKS

### TO USE
INSTALL LATEST FABRIC 1.19.3 or 1.19.4 VERSION

PUT THIS INSIDE OF YOUR MODS FOLDER

MESS WITH THE CONFIG FILE AS MUCH AS YOU WANT!!!!!

this mod does have some bugs in multiplayer so uhh watch out if you're a server owner

any server-side bugs might also be cuz of 'incompatibilities' of sorts with other mods

the mod only needs to be installed server-side!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I do recommend installing it on client and server. Also doesn't work only client-sided unless you're playing singleplayer
(lmao imagine potion cooldowns + totem cooldowns on pvplegacy but only you have them ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€)
