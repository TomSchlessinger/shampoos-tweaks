# TO USE
INSTALL LATEST FABRIC 1.19.3 or 1.19.4 VERSION

PUT THIS INSIDE OF YOUR MODS FOLDER

(OPTIONAL) MESS WITH THE GOOFY AHH CONFIG FILE TO CHANGE SOME OF THE SETTINGS (I AM LAZY AND DON'T WANNA MAKE ALL OF THE SETTINGS MODIFIABLE IN CONFIG)

this mod does have some bugs in multiplayer (or I'm just going F***ING CRAZY!!!!!!!) so uhh watch out ig if you're a server owner

any server-side mods might also be cuz of 'incompatibilities' of sorts with other mods (it's not cuz I suck at programming it's cuz other people do haha)

the mod only needs to be installed server-side!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I do recommend installing it on client and server. Also doesn't work only client-sided unless you're playing singleplayer
